Developed and designed by Tarik Souabny, with some moral support from Petra Brackett.

## Why BostonEV Was Made 🚗
By affecting the way that we approach climate change through sustainable transportation, we are laying the bricks and rock hard foundation for the future that is inevitably to come. We want to address the problems within awareness and demand of electric vehicles. 

As the forward-thinking city that we believe to be, Boston has to take notice and burst the problems bubbling under the surface. Because, as a city, we don’t simply stagnate in action. We’re past that. Beyond that. We are not the city that “wants to make improvements.” We are the city that “makes improvements.” With the legislation and progressive thought already put forward, we are inarguably advantaged to solve the problems prevalent in our city.

And a key problem is the serious amount of damage caused by the emissions of transportation. Especially By approaching these problems, we can not only improve life in Boston, but lay a way forward for others to follow.
